# Project Documentation: Hello World Program in C

## 1. Overview and Summary

This document presents the project documentation for a beginner-friendly "Hello World" program in C. The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple, yet comprehensive example of a C program that can help beginners understand the basic structure and syntax of a C program.

## 2. Key Decisions and Conclusions

The following key decisions were made during the planning phase:

- The program will be written in ANSI C to ensure broad compatibility across different systems.
- The program will follow good coding practices, including proper indentations and variable naming conventions.
- The code will include comments explaining the basic structure and key elements of the code to aid beginner understanding.

## 3. Important Details Discussed

The important details discussed for this project include:

- The program must compile without errors.
- When run, the program should display "Hello World" on the command line.
- The program will include comments explaining the basic structure and key elements of the code. These will include explanations for '#include <stdio.h>', 'int main()', and 'return 0;'.
- This feature has been given a low priority as it is a basic requirement for any beginner programmer learning C.

## 4. Action Items or Next Steps

The following are the next steps for this project:

1. **Code Development:** Write the "Hello World" program in C, following the specifications outlined in the feature description.
2. **Code Review:** Review the code to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria and follows good coding practices.
3. **Testing:** Compile and run the program to ensure it displays "Hello World" on the command line without any errors.
4. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation with the final version of the code and any additional notes or explanations as necessary.

This README will be updated as the project progresses and more information becomes available. It serves as the central source of truth for this project and will be useful for both current team members and any future contributors.
