# Project Documentation: Simple Python Calculator

## 1. Overview and Summary

This project aims to create a simple calculator using Python. The primary motivation behind this is to apply and enhance Python programming skills while providing a tool that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

The user story for this project is as follows: "As a Python learner, I want to create a simple calculator so that I can apply and enhance my Python programming skills and provide a tool that can perform basic arithmetic operations."

## 2. Key Decisions and Conclusions

The calculator should be able to perform the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The calculator should accept two numbers as inputs and return the correct result of the operation.

## 3. Important Details Discussed

Technical considerations for this project include:

- Using Python built-in functions to perform the arithmetic operations.
- Handling exceptions, such as division by zero.
- Implementing input/output functions to interact with the user.

## 4. Action Items or Next Steps

The next steps for this project are as follows:

- Design the calculator interface.
- Implement the functionality for each arithmetic operation.
- Implement the input/output functions.
- Test the calculator to ensure it works as expected and handles edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

The priority for this project is flexible and can be adjusted based on the current learning objectives and resources available.

## Conclusion

This project provides an excellent opportunity to apply and enhance Python programming skills. It also results in a useful tool that can perform basic arithmetic operations. As the project progresses, additional features or improvements may be identified and added to the project scope.
