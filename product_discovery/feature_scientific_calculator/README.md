# Project Documentation for Scientific Calculator in Python

## Overview and Summary

The project is focused on developing a scientific calculator using the Python programming language. The calculator will be capable of performing a wide range of mathematical and scientific calculations, from basic arithmetic to complex numbers and equation solving. Our goal is to provide a tool that is useful for students and professionals who frequently need to perform scientific calculations.

## Key Decisions and Conclusions

1. The calculator will be developed in Python, leveraging its math and cmath libraries for mathematical and complex number operations.
2. The user interface will be developed using a GUI library like Tkinter to ensure it is user-friendly and intuitive.
3– The calculator will support a wide range of mathematical and scientific operations, as well as the ability to work with complex numbers and solve equations.
4. The calculator will provide error messages for invalid inputs and will be thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy and reliability.
